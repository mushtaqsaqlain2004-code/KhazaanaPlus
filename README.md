# 🌟 Khazaana+ — Decentralized Note Storing System

> **Your personal on-chain vault for notes — secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant.**

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**Khazaana+** (meaning *Treasure Chest*) is a **decentralized note-storing dApp** built on blockchain technology.  
It allows users to **store, update, and manage personal notes** directly on the blockchain — no central servers, no third parties, and complete ownership of your data.

Each user (wallet address) has their **own note space**, and all operations — adding, editing, deleting — are securely recorded on-chain.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Lets users **create, view, and manage notes** from their own wallet.
- Stores all data on the blockchain — **no centralized database**.
- Provides transparency and immutability — every change is verifiable.
- Emits **events** for easy integration with frontends (React, Ethers.js, etc.).

> ⚠️ **Note:** Blockchain data is public. For private notes, you should **encrypt your note content off-chain** before storing.
